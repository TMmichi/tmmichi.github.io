description: In this project, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm that mitigates the aforementioned issues by decomposing the original task in a hierarchy and by compounding pretrained primitives with intents. We show how the proposed scheme can be employed in practice by solving a pick and place task with a 6 DoF manipulator.
